      I grew up fishing with my brothers for walleye, bass, and pike in local waters, and my family has always been close. In life it's easy to take the ones you love for granted, but I look back on those times as some of my favorites. I have to say that I’ve been enjoying fishing with family more and more since I got my new Alumacraft. Not only is being out on the boat a blast for everyone, it makes it easy and safe to bring my young nieces and nephew, who aren’t ready to join me wading in a river. Even if we aren’t catching fish, the kids are still excited to ride on Auntie Bekk's boat!<br><br>
      Coming from a family that has always enjoyed time in the outdoors together, I can say that fishing is without a doubt one of the activities that has kept us close. From me to you, here are five reasons hanging out with family and fishing rocks!
