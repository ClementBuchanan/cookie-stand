## Project Name

Building an application that calculates daily sales projections for each location (on a page called sales.html), I also created a public-facing page (on the homepage index.html) that is colorful, eye-catching, readable, useful, and informative.

### Reflections and Comments
* This was a difficult project but I'm still working on it
* A lot is riding on my successful completion of this program. As for my motivation, they are all intrinsic. Once I start something I aim to se it through. Today's lessons were particularly difficult partly because of computer problems but primarily because it takes me a bit longer than most to digest any topic. I believe I mentioned before that I am an after thinker and being that, I have to digest things in my own way so I can learn it. One thing I know for sure is that when it sinks in its in. Intrinsically I strive to finish this program because this new path I've taken can result in a huge improvement for me and my family. To re-iterate, a lot is riding on this and I MUST see it to fruition.
* Phew! What a day. What a day. Thanks to Brai and Nicco (TA's), Glenn and Mickey they each played. role in helping get to here. Wherever here is, it works. As weird as it sounds I am excited bout tomorrows lesson (css). Even though I went for some time past the 15 minute rule I must admit I regret doing that. Sometime I still feel apprehensive about doing that because I really feel like a tool sometimes. I just don't like bugging people. Never have.
